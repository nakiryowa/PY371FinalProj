# PY371FinalProj
Code I wrote for my PY371 final project.
I aimed to take an image (in this case, of the moon), run it through an image transformation using Python on a Raspberry Pi,
and send that data to an Arduino that would light up a LED matrix accordingly (e.g. it would display a photo of the moon).
